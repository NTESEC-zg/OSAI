- AUTOSAR(AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture)
- CCM(CORBA Component Model), a component model based on the CORBA middleware. 
- IEC 61499, an open communication standard for automation and distributed control systems extended by IEC 61131.
- Rubus, a domain-specific component model focusing on real-time properties and resource-constraint problems.It runs on the top of the Rubus OS.
- SOFA 2.0, an extension of the SOFA(Software Appliances) component model with features like dynamic reconfiguration, control parts, and multiple communication patterns.
- TwinCAT(The Windows Control and Automation Technology), a PC-based automation software developed by Beckhoff. TwinCAT offers TcCOM (TwinCAT Component Object Model) derived from the COM (Component Object Model) to define characteristics and behaviors of application modules. 

 Following the dimensions in basic requirements and advanced features, the characteristics of these component models are collected in table â… .

We choose both domain-specific and general models to make this comparison more meaningful. 

 In addition, some of the component models satisfying "platform independent" are only compatible with platforms with particular constraints, like SOFA 2.0 just for platforms supporting JVM(Java Virtual Machine). 

> On the one hand, support for hierarchical architecture and an explicit, clear, well-defined interface definition are of great benefit for a component model.

On the other hand, except no language restrictions, the OSAI component model provides advanced features including multiple communication styles, multiple instantiations, and support for runtime dynamic and periodic tasks, 

 From the contrast of the characteristics defined in the table, we can observe that the OSAI component model is a  comprehensive and rich architecture owning multiple features and balancing them well.

As a matter of fact, although the OSAI component model is designed for ICS, it can also apply to general embedded distributed systems to some extent. 





>  Support for hierarchical architecture and an explicit, clear, well-defined interface definition are of great benefit for the component model, whenever improving of reusability or interoperability.

>  We can see that most models are platform independent, however, some of them are only compatible with platforms with particular constraints, like SOFA 2.0 just for platforms supporting JVM(Java Virtual Machine).

> Besides, advanced features, such as language independence, support for multiple communication styles, and runtime dynamics, allow for better flexibility for systems.

> For example, dynamic runtime support for component models, i.e. ,components can be updated, loaded and unloaded with minimal downtime, is an important feature for long-running systems. Similarly, multiple communication styles enable better abstraction of communication middleware and allow for easier building of heterogeneous distributed systems [C].Support for different programing languages for implementing increases the possibility that the component model may provide richer functionalities. Moreover,the multi-instance feature can effectively enhance system efficiency and performance for specific purposes.
